# ShockExposure
 Analysing the effects of pre-natal drought exposure on early childhood health indicators. 

 Here I include my Bachelor Thesis in Economics from the University of St. Gallen.
 I provide a translated version of the STATA code to Python and might add additional pieces. 

 I signed a non-disclosure which prohibits me from sharing the DHS data. But the data can be requested on the DHS website.

 (Work in progress)
